# Collatz-Conjecture-Tests
Two programs that test a famous mathematical problem. The Collatz Conjecture in which you take any number, if it's even you divide it by 2, if it's odd you multiply it
by 3 and add 1, by repeating the process, eventually the number will go back to 1.
The equation looks like
```
f(n) = n/2 (if n is even)
     = 3n + 1 (if n is odd)
```
The programs are written in different languages. One is in C++ and the other one is in
Python. The reason being is that, there were erros encountered in the C++ program when the numbers became larger and larger the computations became in accurate.
The one python computes fine and accurately as far as I know. The output is printed to the terminal. The code can be also tweaked a bit if you just want to display it on
the terminal.
```
Out put example would look like:
1: leads back to 1
2: leads back to 1
3: leads back to 1
etc...
```
